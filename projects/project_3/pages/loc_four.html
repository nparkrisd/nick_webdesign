  <p class="desc">As I got older I moved back to New York <br> transitioning between both my mother <br> and father.  Syracuse was similar to LaFayette <br> not only because it was so close <br> but had a very low diversity.  Although, <br> unlike LaFayette it was a city, which <br> was a relief because I couldnâ€™t <br> stand living in the country.  I had <br> graduated from high school in <br> Syracuse with plans to go to RISD.</p>
