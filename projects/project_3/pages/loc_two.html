  <p class="desc">Wilmington was amazing for its community, <br> scenery, and housing, or at least where <br> I had lived. I moved to there when I <br> was ten years old because of a divorce.  My mother was <br> going to school to be a teacher in Wilmington and lived <br> with her boyfriend Roldan.  Roldan was a <br> very renowned artist in wilmington <br> at the time.  At this stage in my life I had <br> become a different person because of the <br> diversity here, which was <br> Something LaFayette didnâ€™t have.</p>
