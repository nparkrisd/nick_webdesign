  <p class="desc">After living in Wilmington for three years we <br> moved to my mothers shop on South <br> Street Philly.  This was around the time I was becoming <br> more and more interested in art.  Roldan, my moms <br> boyfriend had taught me how to paint, spray paint, and <br> even make Jewelry.  I had helped sell things in the shop <br> for almost two years until we had to shut down.</p>
