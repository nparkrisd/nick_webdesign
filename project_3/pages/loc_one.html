  <p class="desc">LaFayette is a small town located <br> in the the upstate New York area <br> and has been considered as a <br> true rural area.  I was born <br> here and lived here for most of my life up  <br> until about 10 years old. Living in such <br> emptiness was hard especially for a <br> kid, it felt almost impossible <br> to find something to do <br> when the closest stores were <br> five miles away.</p>
